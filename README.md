In This talk i will unleash the dragons you will see how to compile Java and possible near any other lang to Nativ shared lib and use that as NodeJS Module that implements ffi calls to the shared lib. No JVM installation needed. 

## Spoiler Alert
This is not the fastest way to exchange a hugh amount of data that comes with its own Dragons that got a donky Head i wonder where that come from. 
Any way this methods do show you how to create Shared Libs that you can use with any coding language like Python and so on i choosed Java as the Source Language because that got its own VM and that is able to compile and run Polyglot code and also analyze that with a uniq set of tools.
